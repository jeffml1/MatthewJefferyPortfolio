I have some experience with this that I would like to share with you.</p> <p>Hello everyone, I hope you’re all well.</p> <p>I’m still a bit fresh to web development, having only 6 months of part-time work experience with Logic Studio as I finish up my B.I.T. at the Otago Polytechnic. The main programming languages I use at work are: PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL for databases</p> <p>After re-familarising myself with these languages, I was assigned a new website (<a href="https://www.boys-trip.co.nz">BoysTrip</a>) to build in Silverstripe, a language with which I had no experience. With no time to crank out a textbook and do some light reading, I did what any good coder does: learn as you go. Of course, I ran into many problems but am lucky to work with a great team who are always eager to help me out. Never be scared to ask for help, whether from your classmates, your teachers, your co-workers, or people within the online community, like me!</p> <p>After much trial and error, I managed to understand Silverstripe enough to create something beautiful. While it took me far longer to create this site than a Senior Developer, it’s important to acknowledge where you stand; How much experience you have and what you can do with that to help your future work. If you put in the effort, you can learn a language and apply it to your work. After launching the website, our client gave me excellent feedback, <em>“Once again thanks for all your help with this, you’ve done an outstanding job”</em>.</p> <p>After finishing this website, we were asked to create a similar website by a business who were so impressed by it that they wanted their own, requesting me to build it! I was excited to continue using Silverstripe and to work with another professional client. With the previous website as my model, creating the second will only take a fraction of the time. I was able to copy+paste the backend code and make small touch-ups on the frontend.</p> <p>Despite taking longer to create my first Silverstripe website, it was a valuable learning experience in the framework, handling clients and as a web developer in general.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and remember, everything you don’t know is something you can learn to make yourself a better and more robust programmer.</p> </div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/materialize.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/init.js"></script> </body> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="footer-copyright" style="padding-left: 30px;"> <i class="material-icons" style="padding-right:5px; display:inital;">copyright</i><p style="display:inital;">2018 Copyright Matthew Jeffery | All rights reserved</p> </div> </footer> </html>
