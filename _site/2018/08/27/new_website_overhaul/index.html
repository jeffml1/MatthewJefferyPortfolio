I’ve set up the contact page to send your messages directly to my email so we may communicate with each other more effectively. I hope that this will encourage you to give me feedback on things like my writing style and the kind of content you would like to see on this blog.</p> <p>I elected to use a pre-made Jekyll theme as it saves me a lot of time, which is sparse while I’m still a student (poor in time and moneys…). If you like the look of it, you can check the theme out <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-material-theme/">here</a>.</p> <p>Another reason I opted to move away from WordPress was because I found the WordPress theme took an absurdly long time to load. However, the plugins I had may have also contributed to the site loading slowly. The static Jekyll site has increased the overall performance of the website, which in turn will stop potential readers from giving up as they wait for the website to load.</p> <p>I think this will be a temporary theme, as it still lacks some of the functionality I like to see on blogs, such as sections for ‘recent posts’ and ‘about me’. While I will add these pages in regardless of the theme, in the future, you will be seeing a lot of changes being made to this site. Eventually, I hope to make my own theme, which I may share (maybe on Wordpress of through Jekyll) if it turns out well.</p> <p>Please let me know your thoughts on the new theme and what kind of content you’d like to see from me by using the contact page.</p> <p>Thanks for your time, as always, and have a good day.</p> </div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/materialize.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/init.js"></script> </body> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="footer-copyright" style="padding-left: 30px;"> <i class="material-icons" style="padding-right:5px; display:inital;">copyright</i><p style="display:inital;">2018 Copyright Matthew Jeffery | All rights reserved</p> </div> </footer> </html>
