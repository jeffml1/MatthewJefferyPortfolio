This was a great idea and after doing some research of my own, I came up with a condensed list of the primary reasons why your WordPress website might have slow loading times.</p> <h5 id="wordpress-configuration">WordPress Configuration</h5> <p>Ensure your website is properly configured by using cached pages. If your server isn’t using cached pages, it will overload your server, thus causing your website to run slowly and potentially crash.</p> <h5 id="bad-plugins">Bad Plugins</h5> <p>If you are using poorly developed or outdated plugins, you may find your website is drastically slowed down.</p> <h5 id="wordpress-serves-dynamic-pages">WordPress Serves Dynamic Pages</h5> <p>As WordPress pages are dynamic (i.e., built on the fly when someone visits your page and there is a fair amount of processing happening behind the scenes when you first load a page. Instead, use a caching plugin, which can increase the page’s loading speed by up to 5 times.</p> <h5 id="the-most-popular-wordpress-cache-plugin">The Most Popular WordPress Cache Plugin</h5> <p>The most popular caching plugin for Wordpress that I found was <em>W3 Total Cache</em>. It improves server performance by caching everything on your site and offers content delivery network integrations.</p> <p>So, that’s my list of reasons why WordPress page load speeds can take millions of years, I hope you’ve been able to learn something from my quick research efforts. If you would like to see me discuss anything else on this blog, please don’t hesitate to use the contact section on the home page to let me know. Thanks again for your time and feedback and as always, have a great day.</p> </div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/materialize.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/init.js"></script> </body> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="footer-copyright" style="padding-left: 30px;"> <i class="material-icons" style="padding-right:5px; display:inital;">copyright</i><p style="display:inital;">2018 Copyright Matthew Jeffery | All rights reserved</p> </div> </footer> </html>
