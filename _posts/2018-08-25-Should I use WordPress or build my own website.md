When building your own portfolio/website, should you use Wordpress for convenience or
should you invest time in building it yourself?

Hello everyone, I’m thinking about tearing down this
WordPress site and creating my own website from scratch. The primary reason I’m
considering this is because I don’t want you to have to sign up to Wordpress just to
leave comments and communicate with me. At the moment, I’m pretty keen on building
a simple Jekyll website for this blog, in addition to my own theme.

Please feel free to leave your opinions in the comments below or contact me directly. I’d
really appreciate hearing your thoughts on whether I should create a new website or
stick with what I’ve got here.

Have a good day.
