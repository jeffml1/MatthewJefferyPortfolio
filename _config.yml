project_one: "Internet of Things"
project_one_description: "For Project 1 in the B.I.T course I joined the Internet of Things group. This project focuses on the inter-networking of devices such as smart devices, sensors, software, and other items embedded with electronics. The IoT uses slightly different technology than WiFI to achieve this goal. Our IoT solution is implemented using LoRaWAN. The idea is to research and develop an open LoRaWAN consisting of one or more gateway devices, multiple sensor devices, and a central server. All of this in the Dunedin area, to provide access to user data for use in custom mobile/web/desktop applications."
