When building a website in a framework you don’t know, don’t be worried! I have some experience with this that I would like to share with you.

Hello everyone, I hope you’re all well. 

I’m still a bit fresh to web development, having only 6 months of part-time work experience with Logic Studio as I finish up my B.I.T. at the Otago Polytechnic. The main programming languages I use at work are: PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL for databases

After re-familarising myself with these languages, I was assigned a new website ([BoysTrip](https://www.boys-trip.co.nz)) to build in Silverstripe, a language with which I had no
experience. With no time to crank out a textbook and do some light reading, I did
what any good coder does: learn as you go. Of course, I ran into many problems but am
lucky to work with a great team who are always eager to help me out. Never be scared
to ask for help, whether from your classmates, your teachers, your co-workers, or people
within the online community, like me!

After much trial and error, I managed to understand Silverstripe enough to create
something beautiful. While it took me far longer to create this site than a Senior
Developer, it’s important to acknowledge where you stand; How much experience you
have and what you can do with that to help your future work. If you put in the effort, you
can learn a language and apply it to your work. After launching the website, our client gave me excellent feedback, *“Once again thanks for all your help with this, you’ve done
an outstanding job”*.

After finishing this website, we were asked to create a similar website by a business who
were so impressed by it that they wanted their own, requesting me to build it! I was
excited to continue using Silverstripe and to work with another professional client. With
the previous website as my model, creating the second will only take a fraction of the time. I
was able to copy+paste the backend code and make small touch-ups on the frontend.

Despite taking longer to create my first Silverstripe website, it was a valuable learning
experience in the framework, handling clients and as a web developer in general.

Thanks for reading and remember, everything you don’t know is something you can
learn to make yourself a better and more robust programmer.
